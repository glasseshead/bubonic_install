# Bubonic by glasseshead (David Sun)
A solo-programmed VEX V5 program made with Python for Autonomous programming using a digital plottable field.
Made for use with Arson, Yaay! architectures and Plague? Where? by David

## Usage
When you first install Bubonic from this link:

[https://github.com/glasseshead/bubonic_setup](https://github.com/glasseshead/bubonic_setup)

You should recieve a .zip file in either `Downloads` or your specified file location. 

Go to that file location in your filesystem, and unzip the file.

After unzipping the file, you can go to `bubonic_linux`, where you should be able to access the file by making sure it is set to `"Run as a program"` or any similar settings. 

After doing so, you may peruse the below information to assist you in using Bubonic. Your `path.cpp` file will be in the home directory under the folder `bubonicOutput`.

Have fun!

## Features
- **Path and pose visualizer**
  - By plotting points, a line will appear tracing the path your robot theoretically takes

- **Field path plotting**  
  - Real time interactive path plotting using a Python-powered interface

- **Visual rendering**  
  - VEX V5 blank field rendered in high quality supporting:
    - Robot
      - Robot theta indicator
   - Field Perimeter
    - Checkerboarded tiles
    - Path rendering
      - Lines from point to point in red
      - Currently drawing line in cyan

- **Automated autonomous code programming**
  - Bubonic is capable of automatically writing autonomous code for PROS and LemLib
  - Same format as Arson structures

- **Rotational control**
  - Capability to rotate in 1 degree increments/decrements
  - Capability to rotate in 90 degree increments/decrements

- **High-frequency enhanced telemetry**
  - Optimized for low flicker and high refresh rate
  - Integrated telemetry in program
  - Non-terminal, graphical

- **Pose zeroing support**
  - Capability to zero the current pose and writing zeroing data to file

- **Data clearing support**
  - Capability to clear all contents of pose data and code

- **Arson, Yaay! and Plague? Where? compatability**
  - Designed to be compatible with Arson- and Plague-based structures and can be modifiable for other architectures

## Controls
- Add point = Left Mouse Click
- Rotate robot pose by 1° = A/D
- Rotate robot pose by 90° = Shift + A/D
- Reset origin/zero pose = E
- Zero current heading = S
- Clear pose data = Z
- Clear code poses = Q

## Notes
- inPerTick is already set, do not change it at all
- May require pygame dependencies
